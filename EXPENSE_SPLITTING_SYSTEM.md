This is a comprehensive expense splitting and balance calculation system that handles complex multi-person expenses with various split types, optimized settlement calculations, and precise currency handling.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Features

1. **Multiple Split Types**

   - Total paid and total share tracking
   - Comprehensive debt relationship mapping

3. **Settlement Optimization**
   - Minimizes number of required transactions
   - Uses greedy algorithm for optimal debt resolution

### Data Models

```typescript
// Enhanced expense model supporting multiple split types
interface EnhancedExpense {
  id: string;
  tripId: string;
  description: string;
  amount: number;
  currency: string;
  paidBy: string;
  paidByName: string;
  date: Date;
  splitType: 'EQUAL' | 'PERCENTAGE' | 'CUSTOM' | 'SHARES';
  participants: ParticipantShare[];
  category?: string;
}

// Participant share with flexible value interpretation
interface ParticipantShare {
  userId: string;
  name: string;
  value: number; // percentage, amount, or shares
  amount?: number; // calculated amount
}

// User balance with comprehensive tracking
interface UserBalance {
  userId: string;
  name: string;
  balance: number; // net balance (+ = owed money, - = owes money)
  totalPaid: number;
  totalOwed: number;
  totalShare: number;
}

// Optimized settlement recommendation
interface Settlement {
  from: string;
  fromName: string;
  to: string;
  toName: string;
  amount: number;
}
```

## Key Algorithms

### 1. Currency Distribution Algorithm

Ensures precise distribution of amounts with proper rounding:

```typescript
static distribute(total: number, shares: number): number[] {
  const baseAmount = Math.floor(total * 100 / shares) / 100;
  const remainder = this.round(total - (baseAmount * shares));
  
  const distribution = Array(shares).fill(baseAmount);
  
  // Distribute remainder cents to first few participants
  let remainderCents = Math.round(remainder * 100);
  for (let i = 0; i < remainderCents && i < shares; i++) {
    distribution[i] = this.round(distribution[i] + 0.01);
  }
  
  return distribution;
}
```

### 2. Settlement Optimization Algorithm

Minimizes the number of transactions using a greedy approach:

```typescript
private optimizeSettlements(debtGraph: Map<string, Map<string, number>>): Settlement[] {
  // Calculate net balances for each user
  const netBalances = this.computeNetBalances(debtGraph);
  
  // Separate creditors and debtors
  const creditors = [...]; // positive balances
  const debtors = [...];   // negative balances
  
  // Sort for optimal matching (largest amounts first)
  creditors.sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]);
  debtors.sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]);
  
  // Generate minimal transactions using greedy approach
  const settlements = [];
  // Match largest debts with largest credits...
  
  return settlements;
}
```

### 3. Multi-Split Type Handler

Supports different splitting algorithms based on expense type:

```typescript
private calculateShares(expense: EnhancedExpense): ParticipantShare[] {
  switch (expense.splitType) {
    case 'EQUAL':
      return this.calculateEqualShares(expense, shares);
    case 'PERCENTAGE':
      return this.calculatePercentageShares(expense, shares);
    case 'CUSTOM':
      return this.calculateCustomShares(expense, shares);
    case 'SHARES':
      return this.calculateWeightedShares(expense, shares);
  }
}
```

## API Usage

Optimized: 1 transaction
```

### Scenario 3: Complex Trip
```
- Alice pays $120 group dinner (equal split among 4)
- Bob pays $200 hotel (50/50 with Alice)
- Charlie pays $80 groceries (custom amounts)

### Scenario 4: Perfect Balance
```
- Alice pays $60 lunch (equal split among 3)
- Bob pays $60 taxi (equal split among 3)  
- Charlie pays $60 entertainment (equal split among 3)
Result: No settlements needed - perfectly balanced!
Optimized: 0 transactions
```
