# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
This Trip Management System follows a modern full-stack architecture with clean separation of concerns, implementing a complete CRUD application with participant management capabilities. The system uses Next.js for both frontend and backend, TypeScript for type safety, and MongoDB for data persistence.

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. File-based Routing
- Next.js automatic routing based on file structure in `pages/` directory
- API routes in `pages/api/` for backend endpoints
- Dynamic routes using bracket notation `[id].tsx` for individual trip pages
- Nested routing for trip management (`/trips/[id]/edit`)

### 2. Database Connection Pattern
- Singleton pattern for MongoDB connection to prevent connection pooling issues
- Connection caching to reuse existing connections
- Error handling and retry logic for database operations
- Environment-based connection strings for development/production

### 3. Component Architecture
- Functional components with TypeScript interfaces for props
- Reusable component library with consistent styling
- Layout component wrapping all pages for consistent structure
- Form components with built-in validation and error handling

### 4. API Design Pattern
- RESTful API endpoints following standard HTTP methods
- Consistent response format with success/error states
- Comprehensive error handling with descriptive messages
- Request validation at API level

## Critical Implementation Paths

### Trip Management Flow
1. **Homepage** → User sees welcome page with navigation options
2. **Trip List** → User views all existing trips with summary information
3. **Trip Creation** → User fills form to create new trip with participants
4. **Trip Detail** → User views complete trip information
5. **Trip Editing** → User modifies trip details and participants

### Database Operations Flow
1. Connection establishment with MongoDB using Mongoose
2. Request validation using Mongoose schemas
3. CRUD operations with proper error handling
4. Response formatting and client delivery

### Form Handling Pattern
1. Client-side validation with real-time feedback
2. Form submission with loading states
3. API call with error handling
4. Success/error feedback to user
5. Navigation or state updates

## Component Interaction Patterns

### Layout Structure
```
Layout (Navigation + Footer)
├── Homepage (Hero + Features + Status)
├── Trip List Page
│   └── TripList Component
│       └── Trip Cards with Actions
├── Trip Detail Page
│   └── TripDetail Component
│       └── Participant Management
├── Trip Creation Page
│   └── TripForm Component
│       └── Participant Adding/Editing
└── Trip Edit Page
    └── TripForm Component (with initial data)
```

### State Management
- Local component state for form handling
- Server state through API calls
- Loading states for better UX
- Error states with user feedback

## API Architecture Patterns

### RESTful Endpoints
- `GET /api/trips` - List all trips
- `POST /api/trips` - Create new trip
- `GET /api/trips/[id]` - Get specific trip
- `PUT /api/trips/[id]` - Update trip
- `DELETE /api/trips/[id]` - Delete trip

### Response Standardization
```typescript
{
  success: boolean
  data?: any
  error?: string
  message?: string
  count?: number
}
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- Validation errors return 400 with details
- Not found errors return 404
- Server errors return 500 with generic message
- Client-side error boundaries for UI errors

## Data Modeling Patterns

### Trip Model Structure
```typescript
Trip {
  _id: ObjectId
  name: string (required, max 100 chars)
  people: Person[] (required, min 1)
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}

Person {
  name: string (required)
  email?: string (optional, validated format)
}
```

### Validation Layers
1. **Client-side**: Real-time form validation
2. **API-level**: Request validation before processing
3. **Database-level**: Mongoose schema validation
4. **Business logic**: Custom validation rules

## User Experience Patterns

### Navigation Flow
- Consistent navigation bar across all pages
- Breadcrumb-style navigation for trip details
- Clear action buttons with consistent styling
- Back/cancel buttons for form operations

### Form Interaction Patterns
- Real-time validation with immediate feedback
- Loading states during submission
- Success messages with navigation
- Error handling with retry options
- Keyboard navigation support (Enter to add participants)

### Responsive Design Patterns
- Mobile-first CSS approach
- Flexible grid systems
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Readable typography across screen sizes

## Performance Optimization Patterns

### Frontend Optimizations
- Next.js automatic code splitting
- Component-level loading states
- Efficient re-rendering with proper key props
- CSS optimization with custom framework

### Backend Optimizations
- MongoDB connection pooling
- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Efficient query patterns
- Response compression

## Security Patterns

### Input Validation
- Client-side validation for UX
- Server-side validation for security
- MongoDB injection prevention through Mongoose
- Type checking with TypeScript

### Error Information
- Generic error messages to prevent information disclosure
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Input sanitization

## Code Organization Principles

### Separation of Concerns
- **Pages**: Route handling and data fetching
- **Components**: UI logic and presentation
- **API Routes**: Business logic and data operations
- **Models**: Data structure and validation
- **Styles**: Presentation and layout

### Type Safety
- TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Proper typing for component props
- API response type definitions
- Database model type integration

### Reusability
- Generic form components
- Consistent button and input styling
- Shared layout components
- Utility functions for common operations

## Testing Strategy Patterns

### Manual Testing Completed
- API endpoint testing with curl
- Form validation testing
- Navigation flow testing
- Error handling verification
- Responsive design testing

### Automated Testing Framework (Future)
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end testing for user flows
- Performance testing for optimization
